		As any character the player chooses, the player will begin to go around a hub world---or a ``location from which a player can venture out into different areas of a game\textsuperscript{[1]}''. When they see an arrow (or some indication that the path to begin the level is that way), there is a sign that has items that are required. The player must buy those specific items given a certain amount of money before playing the level. The player goes to the mall and shop for the level-required items at a few stores\iffalse ; the player will understand a short course of marketing as they learn for themselves how they buy products like in the real world.\fi After purchasing the level-required items, the player will go to the level. There are a few types of levels including fighting, driving, and jumping. After accomplishing a level, they will go to another hub world and repeat the same procedure. After completing all of the levels, the player will go to the final level of the zone and fight with the boss before moving on to another world. \newline \newline
