	\newpage
	\section*{GAMEPLAY}
	\textbf{Title} is an action-adventure platformer, where the player walks around a hub world---a ``location from which a player can venture out into different areas of a game\textsuperscript{[1]}''. When they see an arrow (or some indication that the path to begin the level is that way), there is a sign that shows the items required to play the level. Given a certain amount of money, the player must buy those specific items before playing the level. The player goes to the World Mall and shop for the level-required items at a few stores. \newline \newline
	After purchasing the level-required items, the player will go to the level---ergo, this is where the gameplay begins. There are seven types of levels in \textbf{Title}:
	\begin{description}[align=right,labelwidth=3cm,noitemsep]
		\item [Fight Level:] A stage where the player mainly fights enemies
		\item [Platform Level:] A stage where the player jumps, swings, bounces, or perform any other body movement through obstacles
		\item [Speed Level:] A stage where the player runs or uses a vehicle and requires speed to pass the level
		\item [Dig Level:] A stage where the player has to dig underground
		\item [Puzzle Level:] A stage where the player has to solve a series of puzzles to pass the level
		\item [Stealth Level:] A stage where the player has to hide from enemies to pass the level
		\item [Combo Level:] the boss stage that mixes up all (three) of the types of stages (given in the World)
	\end{description}
	After accomplishing a level, they will go to another hub world and repeat the same procedure. After completing all of the levels, the player will go to the final level of the World, where the player will play another level before fighting the boss. After defeating the boss, the player will move on to another World.
	%includegraphics[width=in]{}
	\subsection*{GAME WORLD}
	\textbf{Title} contains eight worlds, each of the first seven having 4 separate hub worlds---each of them connecting three levels and one of them with a boss level and fight, making that four levels in total. \textbf{Title} uses a hub system where the characters have to explore a separate world from the levels in order to enter each level. %See Figure \ref{Map} for how the map works in each World. \newline \newline
	Players can go to any level. However, when going from one hub to another, the player will have to play the level again to go back into Hub World 1 because \iffalse each level is different when going from one hub world to another (e.g., if the player goes to Level 1 from Hub World 1 to Hub World 2, then the level will be different if the player goes from Hub World 2 to Hub World 1);\fi it is the central area that connects to all of the Hub Worlds. Some levels do not need to be played again in some cases, though the player has to go through the level again. (For example, if the player completed a Puzzle Level by unlocking a door---for instance---then there is no need to do it again; however, the player has to go back from the door towards Hub World 1.) \newline \newline
	Once all three levels are found and cleared, the player can then move onto the boss level. In the hub, players can also switch between past Worlds that were completed.

Options lets players change the settings on the game. \newline \newline
	\noindent The beginning of the game will have a scene that lets the player play a short visual novel game---or ``interactive fiction that usually have very little in terms of gameplay but focus more on extensive storytelling, character interactions, dialogue trees, decision-making, and branching narratives, as well as artwork, cutscenes, voice acting, and music\textsuperscript{[2]}''---showing \_.
